title: "Informatics 1 - Cognitive Science (INFR08020)"
collection: teaching
university: "University of Edinburgh"
semester: Spring 2018
permalink: /teaching/2018-spring-INFR08020
excerpt: "This course is designed as a first introduction to Cognitive Science. 
It will provide a selective but representative overview of the subject, suitable for all interested students, 
including students on the Cognitive Science degrees and external students. 
The aim is to present a unified view of the field, based on a computational approach to analysing cognition. 
The material is organized by cognitive function (e.g., language, vision), rather than by subdiscipline (e.g., psychology, neuroscience). 
The course covers language, vision and attention, memory, motor control and action, and reasoning and generalization. 
All topics will be presented from a computational point of view, and this perspective
will be reinforced by lab sessions in which students use implementations of cognitive models. 
The course will also provide a basic grounding in the methods of Cognitive Science, focusing on
computational modelling and experimental design."

I was one of the lab demonstrators. 
During the lab sessions, the students learned NumPy and used them to employ pre-existing modeling tools
as well as building (simple) cognitive models.
