I was one of the TAs of the Algebra Workshop. 
In addition to hosting drop-in labs for students to get help with assignments, studying, and exam preparation, 
my other responsibilities include invigilating and grading weekly quizzes, midterms and final exams.
The coordinator of Algebra Workshop is [Justin Gray](https://www.sfu.ca/math/department/faculty/gray--justin.html).
