excerpt: "Algebra Workshops are a casual way for students in [Math 100](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2020/spring/courses/math/100.html) to get the extra support they need, when they need it. Students can drop in to discuss course material with instructors, coordinators, and teaching assistants, or get help with assignments, studying, and exam prep"
