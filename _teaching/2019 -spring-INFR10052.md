title: "Algorithms and Data Structures (INFR10052)"
collection: teaching
university: "University of Edinburgh"
semester: Spring 2019
permalink: /teaching/2019-spring-INFR10052
excerpt: "The course aims to provide general techniques for the design of efficient algorithms and, 
in parallel, develop appropriate mathematical tools for analysing their performance. 
In this, it broadens and deepens the study of algorithms and data structures initiated in INF2. 
The focus is on algorithms, more than data structures. 
Along the way, problem solving skills are exercised and developed."

I hosted two of the tutorial groups, each around 10 students.
Tutorials are designed to enable students to practise the main skills the course
instructors would like to impart in a course. 
Students do some preparation for the tutorials, usually working on some (non-assessed) problems. 
In the tutorials, the students present and discuss their ideas or/and receive feedback.

The instructors of this course is 
[Richard Mayr](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rmayr/).
