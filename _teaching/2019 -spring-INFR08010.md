title: "Informatics 2D - Reasoning and Agents (INFR08010)"
collection: teaching
university: "University of Edinburgh"
semester: Spring 2019
permalink: /teaching/2019-spring-INFR08010
excerpt: "	This course focuses on approaches relating to representation, reasoning and planning for solving real world inference. 
The course illustrates the importance of (i) using a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to efficient reasoning,
and (ii) the need for exploiting task constraints for intelligent search and planning. The notion of representing action, space and time
is formalized in the context of agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that affect the current state. 
There is also a strong emphasis on the ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios 
and hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include inference in probabilistic domains."

I hosted three of the tutorial groups, each around 10 students.
Tutorials are designed to enable students to practise the main skills the course
instructors would like to impart in a course. 
Students do some preparation for the tutorials, usually working on some (non-assessed) problems. 
In the tutorials, the students present and discuss their ideas or/and receive feedback.

The instructors of this course is 
[Vaishak Belle](https://vaishakbelle.com/) and 
[Alex Lascarides](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hshimoda/).
