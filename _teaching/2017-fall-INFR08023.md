I hosted one of the tutorial groups, which consisted of around 10 students.
I was also one of the markers of this course.
Tutorials are designed to enable students to practise the main skills the course
instructors would like to impart in a course. 
Students do some preparation for the tutorials, usually working on some (non-assessed) problems. 
In the tutorials, the students present and discuss their ideas or/and receive feedback.

The instructors of this course is 
[Colin Stirling](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cps/)
and 
[Kousha Etessami](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/kousha/).
