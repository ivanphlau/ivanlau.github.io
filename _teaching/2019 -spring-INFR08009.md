collection: teaching
university: "University of Edinburgh"
semester: Spring 2019
permalink: /teaching/2019-spring-INFR08009
excerpt: "This course presents key symbolic and numerical data structures and algorithms for manipulating them. Introductory numerical and symbolic learning methods provide a context for the algorithms and data structures. To make the presented ideas concrete, the module will extend the student's skills in Java and Matlab. Examples will be taken from all areas of Informatics."

I hosted two of the tutorial groups, each around 10 students.
Tutorials are designed to enable students to practise the main skills the course
instructors would like to impart in a course. 
Students do some preparation for the tutorials, usually working on some (non-assessed) problems. 
In the tutorials, the students present and discuss their ideas or/and receive feedback.

The instructors of this course were 
[Kyriakos Kalorkoti](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Kyriakos_Kalorkoti.html) (for algorithms and data structures)
and 
[Hiroshi Shimodaira](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hshimoda/) (for machine learning).
