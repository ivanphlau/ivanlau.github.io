I hosted two of the tutorial groups, each around 10 students.
Tutorials are designed to enable students to practise the main skills the course
instructors would like to impart in a course. 
Students do some preparation for the tutorials, usually working on some (non-assessed) problems. 
In the tutorials, the students present and discuss their ideas or/and receive feedback.

The instructors of this course is 
[Kyriakos Kalorkoti](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Kyriakos_Kalorkoti.html) (for algorithms and data structures)
and 
[Hiroshi Shimodaira](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hshimoda/) (for machine learning).
