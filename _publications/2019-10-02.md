excerpt: "It is proved that if a left brace A has the operation ∗ associative, then A is a two-sided brace. Consequently, A is a Jacobson radical ring. This answers a question of Cedó, Gateva-Ivanova and Smoktunowicz."

It is proved that if a left brace A has the operation ∗ associative, then A is a two-sided brace. Consequently, A is a Jacobson radical ring. This answers a question of Cedó, Gateva-Ivanova and Smoktunowicz.
