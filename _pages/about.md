I am a 1st year MSc student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.sfu.ca/math.html) at Simon Fraser University,
advised by [Jonathan Jedwab](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jed/).

I received my BSc in computer science and mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in July 2019.
I was advised by [He Sun](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/) for my computer science thesis. 
I was advised by [Agata Smoktunowicz](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people/a-z?person=67) for my mathematics thesis.
