My interests lie broadly in information, computation and optimization
as well as their interactions with other fields and real-world applications
such as communication, cryptography, and signal processing.
I am currently focusing on understanding variants of compressed sensing and group testing beyond standard sparsity
assumption (e.g., adding assumptions of prior information that may be utilized, or replacing the sparsity
assumption with a generative model assumption)
