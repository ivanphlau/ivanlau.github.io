The conference on "[Groups, Rings and associated structures 2019](http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~abachle/gras2019/)" was held at Domain Sol Cress in the beautiful town of Spa, Belgium. It is a sequel to the [meeting held in 2017](http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~abachle/gryb/). The international conference concentrates on recent developments in the areas of ring theory and group theory, with a focus on the interplay between these fields of mathematics, the methods involved in their study and applications to other areas. Some topics of interest are representations of groups and algebras, finitely presented algebras, group rings, unit groups and algebraic structures related to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.

I gave a talk in the 10 MINUTS section. 10 MINUTS section was designed for students and PostDocs to present a fascinating aspect of their research in a short freestyle lecture.
